Everyone needs their car fixed, right?  So how does a web site help you increase
 the number of customers you serve?

**It's permanent**:  Once you build your website, it is out there on the web,
and will continue to interact with your customers, and bring you new business.
Compare this you purchased media like advertising, which goes away and leaves
not a trace after a period of time.

**It's always on**:  Your website is there when someone's car won't start at
2am.  Prevent late night calls, or missing that business by making it possible
for any customer to find your shop at any hour of the day, whether you have
someone manning the phone or not!

**It's where your customers are**:  More than 80% of people looking to engage a
service provider or purchase something begin their search online.  Not having a
professional website means that they don't even see you when they are doing
their research.

**It's mobile**:  Most customers have smart phones today.  It's hard to look at
the yellow pages when you are stranded on the side of the road.  A
mobile friendly website means that your customers can find you no matter where
they are.
