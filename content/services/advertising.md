In many cases, it doesn't!  Effective online advertising requires that
you have a few different pieces in place and working well for you.  If
you have tried online advertising in the past, and it hasn't worked for
you, it's likely that one of the following prerequisites wasn't in place.

**Your website**:  For online advertising to be effective, your website
must be effective.  After all, in most cases, you are driving traffic to
your website with online advertising.  If your website is dated, not
helpful, or doesn't exist then even when you do get clicks on your ad,
they will not turn into a customer.

**The ad text**:  It is super important with online advertising to match
the text of your ad to the page that you will be sending those customers
to, while making it attractive for them.  This can require a fair amount
of experimentation and many of the companies that run online advertising
campaigns seldom optimize and monitor and improve ad text in order to
increase the ad's effectiveness.

**Customer Fit**: Your ads have to fit your customers.  Their 
expectations, their problems, their needs.  Many advertising campaigns
are too general, having been put together by someone that does not 
understand your customers, or your business, and they under-perform due 
to this!

## But...

Done properly, online advertising can massiveley increase the number of 
eyes that wind up on your site, which will increase the number of calls 
that you get, and cars that you service.  At ShopPulse, we are all about
helping you to launch and maintain online advertising campaigns that are
tailored to your business and designed to perform.
